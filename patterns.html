        <p>Welcome to my pattern collection—a cosy corner of crochet where cute characters, amigurumi creatures, and pop culture favourites come to life, one stitch at a time. Whether you're just starting out or looking for a relaxing project, these patterns are designed to be clear, beginner-friendly, and full of personality.</p>

        <p>I believe crochet should be fun, not frustrating. That's why I'm updating my designs to include step-by-step instructions, helpful photos, and straightforward language to guide you from first stitch to final flourish. Many of these patterns are inspired by the shows, stories, and fandoms I love—so expect a little bit of whimsy and a lot of heart.</p>

        <p>Grab your hook and explore—your next adorable make is just a few stitches away.</p>
